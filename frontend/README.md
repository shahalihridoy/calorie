## ðŸš€ Getting started

> By default, this uses Yarn, but this choice is yours. If you'd like to switch to npm, delete the `yarn.lock` file, install the dependencies with `npm install`, and change the CI workflows, Husky Git hooks, and lint-staged steps to use npm commands.

1. `yarn`;
2. `yarn dev`;

or

1. `npm i`
2. `npm run dev`

To view the project open `http://localhost:3000`.
